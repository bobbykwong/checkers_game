*************Future changes to consider

1. Add double jump function
2. Add hints on where player can move. 
3. Redo move function.
4. Allow computer to play defensively. 
5. Current version not mobile responsive. 



*************Area of code to improve on
1. movement function very messy. 
2. Too many conditionals in place. 
3. There may be some unanticipated moves which may cause bugs to the system. Need to think of way to prevent game from crashing when bugs occur
