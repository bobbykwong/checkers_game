2. Practice DOM manipulation
3. Devise logic for element and its restriction on movement..

Minimum Viable Product
1. Board that shows basic images of each checkers piece.
2. Pieces able to move to new grid on the board using dom. Each piece is restricted on movement. Can only move forwards. Movement restriction

	b)	Add element to new position
3. 2 players can play the game
4. programme able to recognise when 1 piece gets captured by an opponent piece.
5. programme recognise win condition when all of the opponent pieces are captured.



Further
1. Let players enter name, show who's turn, and press start game.
2. When a piece reaches the end of the board, it becomes a "king" piece which allows it to move forwards and backwards.
3. Chess piece able to recognise another chess piece that is in the way of it. Obstacle restriction
4. Chess piece able to recognise that it cannot move out of the board. Board restriction
5. CHeck win condition again!!!
