	b) Create dark grids using odd and even conditionals
4. Create virtual board to keep track of movement of pieces.

	b) if piece on n = 0, only can move to next row on position n.
	c) if piece on n = 3, only can move to next row on position n-1.
4. Logic with Obstruction (Player 1)
	a) When friendly piece on row + 1, n or n+1 position, selected piece cannot move forward onto that position.
	b) When opponent piece on row + 1, n or n-1 position, selected piece moves to row + 2
		i) if opponent piece on n position, selected piece moves to row + 2, n+1 position.
		ii) if opponent piece on n-1 position, selected piece moves to row + 2, n-1 position.
		iii) if n+1 or n-1 position does not exist, selected piece cannot move forward.
	c) When opponent piece on row + 1, n or n-1 position, but friendly or opponent piece on (i or ii), selected piece cannot move
		i) if opponent piece on n position, 3rd party on n+1
		ii) if opponent piece on n-1 position, 3rd party on n-1 position.
